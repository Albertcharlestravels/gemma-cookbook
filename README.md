# Welcome to the Gemma Cookbook
This is a collection of guides and examples for [Google Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/).

## Get started with the Gemma models
Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. The Gemma model family includes:
* [base Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card)
* [CodeGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/codegemma)
* [PaliGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma)
* [RecurrentGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/recurrentgemma)

You can find the Gemma models on GitHub, Hugging Face models, Kaggle, Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Garden, and [ai.nvidia.com](ai.nvidia.com).
